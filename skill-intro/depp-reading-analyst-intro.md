## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Recommended Practices

1. **Be Clear About Your Goal** - Tell Claude your reading purpose (learning/problem-solving/reference)
2. **Break Down Long Articles** - Analyze sections first for very long content
3. **Ask Questions** - Actively raise doubts during analysis
4. **Practice Validation** - Request actionable implementation plans
5. **Build Connections** - Ask to relate content to your existing knowledge

### ❌ Things to Avoid

1. Don't analyze too many articles at once (recommend ≤3)
